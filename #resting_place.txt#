          <p>Stellar populations near the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) exhibit active star formation despite a distinctive lack of dense interstellar matter, or resources from which to form stars. I sought to uncover the driving forces behind such intriguing star formation through an extended photometric study of the SMC Wing. Our photometric, spectral, and spatial analyses revealed evidence for a significant star-forming event that occurred ~25-40 Myr ago, creating ~10<sup>4</sup> M☉ of new stars and initiating sequential star formation that continues into the present. The spatial and temporal distribution of young stars in the SMC Wing indicate that star formation proceeded slowly and consistently over millions of years. Continued stellar production within the supergiant shell SMC-SGS 1 suggests a stochastic star formation mode in which molecular clouds survive shell passage, slow the expansion of the shell, and only later form stars. <a href="images/skyscrapers_poster.pdf" target="_blank">Poster</a></p>

          <p>As a Data Reduction Specialist with the National Optical Astronomy Observatory (now <a href="https://noirlab.edu/public/" target="_blank">NOIRLab</a>), I investigated how galactic star-formation rates evolve with redshift (z < 1.5), internal galactic properties, and environmental conditions. By investigating how galactic star formation rates evolve with environmental conditions, we may understand the physical causes responsible for the decline of the cosmic star formation history (e.g. “cosmic high noon”). I performed multi-object spectroscopic data reduction on a sample of galaxies, producing a catalog of redshifts for subsequent investigations.

								<p>Every time we observe the Universe in a new way, we discover new phenomena. The Vera C. Rubin Observatory - previously referred to as the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) - promises to observe the largest area of the sky, more frequently than any other telescope in astronomical history, with sensitive optical instrumentation. With more observations than humans could ever identify by eye in a lifetime, automatic classification becomes a vital element in navigating the next generation of astronomical research. My objective is to develop a flexible anomaly detection algorithm for heterogeneous time series data (e.g. sparse, irregular, heteroscedastic), beginning with a simulated data set developed for the Kaggle Photometric LSST Astronomical Time-Series Classification Challenge (<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/PLAsTiCC-2018">PLAsTiCC</a>). <i>Earthseed</i> references the novel Parable of the Sower by Octavia Butler.</p>
