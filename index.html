	  <h2 class="major">Welcome To My Website</h2>
	  <img src="images/flowers.jpg" style="width:100%"><br><br>
	  Hello! Thank you for coming to my website. I'm grateful to share a little about myself. </p>

	  <p>First things first, I am a devotee of Sri Ramakrishna and the Holy Mother, Sarada Devi. Sri Ramakrishna taught that peace comes by tending to "first God and then the world." He said, "If you put fifty zeros after a one, you have a large sum; but erase the one and nothing remains." God is that one which gives meaning to everything else in the world. <b>My mission</b> is to realize God, by Her grace, while making a living within my passions.</p>

	  <p>What's my passion? <b>Natural healing.</b> Beginning in 2021, severe hip pain led me to seek out <i>any</i> effective and accessible form of therapy. I came across <a href="https://www.abebooks.com//servlet/SearchResults?tn=The+Egoscue+Method+of+Health+Through+Motion" target="_blank">The Egoscue Method of Health Through Motion</a>, a series of postures that encourage the body to repair itself. Desperate for relief, I tried it out. Four months later I was pain free and deeply inspired. I've slowly incorporated daily meditation, vision improvement, and fertility awareness into my natural healing repertoire and am always ambitious to learn more. <a href="#healing">(Healing)</a></p>

	  <p>What're my <i>other</i> passions? Software. El espa&#241ol.  Huh? Here's some background...</p>

	  <p>I earned my bachelor's degree in <b>Astronomy and Spanish</b> from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and studied abroad in Santiago, Chile. As an undergraduate, I conducted research at UW-Madison, Yale University, and the University of Chile. Following graduation I held a post-baccalaureate position at the National Optical Astronomy Observatory (now <a href="https://noirlab.edu/public/" target="_blank">NOIRLab</a>). Finally, I earned my master's degree from the University of Washington as an <b>NSF Graduate Research Fellow</b>. <a href="#research">(Research)</a></p>

<p>Within astronomy, I learned essential skills to succeed in a variety of technical fields. But it took time for me to reimagine my path outside of academia. Luckily, I took the opportunity to pour into my community. I joined <a href="https://www.badgerbots.org/" target="_blank">BadgerBots Robotics</a>, an afterschool education organization, and kickstarted a program to bring state-of-the-art robotics education to underserved students across Madison, WI. In doing so I reconnected with my roots, recentered on my values, and reignited my <b>passion for coding</b>. <a href="#community">(Community)</a></p>

<p>As I reflected on my career as a research scientist, I realized that my most fulfilling project was not in research at all, but in software development. Immediately after college graduation, I had spent a summer at the Space Telescope Science Institute developing a visualization tool to assist in the scheduling of telescope observations. That roller coaster of maddening challenges met with euphoric breakthroughs stuck with me, and attracts me again as I align with the <b>next phase of my career</b>. <a href="#software">(Software)</a></p>

<p>The combination of seemlingly opposite fields has always been my bread and butter. Now, I'm driven to merge my passions for natural healing and software development.</p>

          <p>Space telescopes require dynamic visualization software to efficiently assess their scheduling constraints and ultimately streamline the process of space-based data acquisition. At the Space Telescope Science Institute, I worked with Dr. Mark Giuliano to create this software for the Hubble and James Webb Space Telescopes. My tool incorporated lightweight (computationally inexpensive), interactive (zooming, scrolling), and independent (stand-alone web page) features for optimized use and communication among operations specialists. For my debut software development project, I quickly adopted a product-oriented approach to solving problems, communicating with users and adjusting tool functionality to match their feedback.

	  <p>As an astronomer my research spanned <b>a wide range of astronomical domains</b> including star formation, galaxy evolution, and intersections with data science. <br><br><a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/p_=0&q=author%3A%22FULMER%2C%20LEAH%22&sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc" target="_blank">Explore Publications through the Astrophysics Data System</a></p>

                                                                <h4>Advisor: Prof. Jay Gallagher</h4>

          <p>My first investigation with Prof. Jay Gallagher focused on the formation of isolated galaxies, whose evolutionary histories mimic those of the first galaxies in the Universe. Due to their isolation, these galaxies are thought to evolve with minimal interactions; however, NGC 5523 demonstrates asymmetrical features indicative of disruptive galaxy mergers. My multi-wavelength photometric, or “light measurement”, analysis with the <i>Spitzer Space Telescope</i> and <i>Kitt Peak 3.5- Meter Telescope</i> constrained the timescales of potential collisions between NGC 5523 and former companions, a scenario of “isolation by annexation”. <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.05968.pdf" target="_blank">(Fulmer, Gallagher, & Kotulla, 2017, A&A, 598, A119)</a></p>

          <p>As a Dorrit Hoffleit Research Scholar at Yale University, I worked with Prof. Jeff Kenney to uncover direct evidence of galaxy cluster dynamics within the Virgo Cluster. I joined ultraviolet-through-infrared photometry for 50 Virgo galaxies, modeled the observational data with theoretical spectral energy distributions, and derived physical properties from these models. Our findings revealed a strong connection between galaxy mass, star formation rate, neutral hydrogen gas accretion, and location at the outskirts of the cluster. This trend suggests a common stage of neutral gas accretion among infalling cluster galaxies, and I communicated our exciting developments at the 227th American Astronomical Society (AAS) Meeting. <a href="images/virgo_poster.pdf" target="_blank">(Conference Poster)</a></p>

                                                                <h4>Advisor: Prof. Monica Rubio</h4>

          <p>I interwove my parallel majors in Astronomy and Spanish through an exchange program at the University of Chile. While there, I collaborated with Prof. Monica Rubio to investigate gaseous environments in the Magellanic Clouds, the closest galactic neighbors to our Milky Way. These sister galaxies exhibit ongoing, active star formation despite an unusual lack of dense interstellar gas, the necessary resource to form stars. Therefore, characterizing the size, temperature, luminosity, mass, and other physical properties of their molecular clouds (i.e., stellar birthplaces) allows us to probe the necessary conditions for star formation within sparse environments. My analysis of submillimeter CO observations from the Atacama Large Millimeter Array constrained these physical properties within the Magellanic Clouds, establishing a foundation from which to investigate star formation in low gas densities. In Chile, I engaged in scientific collaboration with one of the leading countries in observational astronomy.</p>

                                                                <h4>Advisor: Prof. Jay Gallagher</h4>

          <p>Upon returning from Chile, I related my understanding of star formation to the subsequent evolution of stellar populations. The Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) demonstrates an active history of massive star formation, as well as giant gaseous shell structures indicative of energetic stellar deaths, or supernovae. Prof. Gallagher and I collaborated with astronomers at the University of Potsdam, Germany to uncover the origins behind such dynamic stellar evolution. By combining a widespread ultraviolet photometric survey with stellar spectroscopy, we exposed erratic, popcorn-like star formation patterns beginning hundreds of millions of years ago and continuing into the present. Most notably, young stars within the volume of the supergiant shell SMC-SGS-1 suggest that some molecular clouds remain stagnant and star-forming even as nearby supernovae expel all other nearby gas and dust.

          <p>As a Data Reduction Specialist at the National Optical Astronomy Observatory (now <a href="https://noirlab.edu/public/" target="_blank">NOIRLab</a>), I explored both cosmological galaxy evolution and web based software development with Dr. Stephanie Juneau. By tracking how galactic star formation rates evolve with their local environments, we may understand the physics responsible for large-scale changes in the cosmic star formation rate. My reduction of spectroscopic data from the ESO VLT Visible Imaging Multi- Object Spectrograph produced a catalog of redshift measurements for a population of roughly 400 massive galaxies previously investigated with Herschel, and laid the groundwork for subsequent studies of their local environments. Simultaneously, I contributed to foundational expansions of the <a href="https://datalab.noirlab.edu/" target="_blank">Astro Data Lab</a>, a webspace that empowers astronomers to explore, visualize, and analyze data from NOIR facilities.
