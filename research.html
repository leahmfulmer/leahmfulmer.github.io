								<h3>Cosmic High Noon: Declining Galactic Star Formation Rates</h3>
								<img class="center fit"src="images/declining_sfr.png" width="1035px" height="400px">
								<p>Following my undergraduate degree, I sought to explore large-scale galaxy evolution as a Data Reduction Specialist at NOAO. With Dr. Stephanie Juneau, I investigate how galactic star-formation rates evolve with redshift (z < 1.5), internal galactic properties, and environmental conditions. Covering ~400 massive Herschel-detected galaxies, this study will improve our understanding of the physical causes responsible for the declining star formation rate. By first producing a catalog of redshifts, I am learning techniques for multi-object spectroscopic data acquisition, reduction, and analysis.

								<h3>Incoming! Evolutionary Trends in Virgo Cluster Galaxies</h3>
								<img class="center fit" src="images/virgo.jpg" width="1035px" height="200px">
								<p>As a Yale Dorrit Hoffleit Research Scholar, I worked with Prof. Jeff Kenney exploring systematic trends in the star formation rates of Virgo Cluster galaxies to ultimately investigate the effects of cosmological structure on galaxy evolution. I first merged ultraviolet-through-infrared archival photometry for 50 Virgo galaxies (data from SDSS, 2MASS, Spitzer, and Herschel), then modeled the observational data with theoretical SEDs (models from Magphys). We found that in the mass range 10<sup>9</sup>-10<sup>10</sup> M<sub>☉</sub>, the galaxies with the highest specific star formation rates were all HI-rich, subject to ongoing gas accretion, and located at the outskirts of the cluster. Our findings reveal HI accretion as a potentially significant stage of infalling galaxy evolution, and <a href="images/virgo_poster.pdf">I presented this work at the 227th AAS Meeting</a>. This experience advanced my programming skills in IDL as well as archival data extraction and quality assurance. Furthermore, it ignited my current passion for large-scale studies of galaxy formation and evolution.

								<h3> NGC 5523: An Isolated Product of Soft Galaxy Mergers? </h3>
								<img class="center fit" src="images/ngc5523_orange.jpg" width="1035px" height="320px">
								<p> My first project with Prof. Jay Gallagher focused on the morphology and evolution of isolated galaxies, which generally offer key insight into the formation of the first galaxy systems. The galaxy NGC 5523 demonstrates a paradoxical combination of global isolation (no massive companions) and asymmetrical features indicative of past interactions. By analyzing multi-band images from Spitzer and WIYN, we found that the asymmetrical features in NGC 5523 most likely arose from one or more non-disruptive mergers between it and former companion galaxies <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.05968.pdf">(Fulmer, Gallagher, & Kotulla, 2017, A&A, 598, A119)</a>. Our result challenges the typical narrative that isolated galaxies evolve with few galaxy-galaxy interactions. With this project, I not only learned the technical skills of IRAF FITS image analysis and galactic photometry, but also collaborated with a team of senior astronomers in the publication of original research.</p>

								<h3> Skyscrapers in a Desert: Observing Ongoing, Active Star Formation in the Low-Density Wing of the Small Magellanic Cloud </h3>
								<img class="center fit" src="images/ngc602_crop.jpg" width="1035px" height="200px">
								<p>

								  </p>The SMC Wing exhibits ongoing, active star formation despite a distinctive lack of dense interstellar matter, or resources from which to form stars. The region appears as if you found skyscrapers in an empty desert: there are clear signs of production without an obvious source of materials. For my Honors Undergraduate Senior Thesis with Prof. Jay Gallagher, I sought to uncover the driving forces behind this paradoxical star formation through an extended photometric study of the SMC Wing. I first extracted near-ultraviolet stellar photometry from GALEX images, then matched these observations to both ESO 1.54m optical photometry and VLT spectra covering the greater SMC Wing. Our photometric, spectral, and spatial analyses reveal evidence for a significant star-forming event that occurred ~30 Myr ago, creating ~10<sup>4</sup> M<sub>☉</sub> of new stars and initiating sequential star formation that continues into the present. These results challenge the notion that NGC 602 evolved in isolation and suggest instead a highly interconnected star formation history for the SMC Wing (Fulmer et. al, MNRAS, in preparation). Throughout this project, I expanded my skills in Python, TOPCAT, IRAF stellar photometry, and kernel density estimate clustering analysis. In collaboration with senior astronomers internationally, <a href="images/skyscrapers_poster.pdf">I presented our results at the 231st AAS Meeting</a> (Chambliss Honorable Mention) and am currently preparing the publication of this research.

                                                                <img class="center fit"src="images/mag_bridge.jpg" width="1035px" height="320px">
                                                                <p> At the University of Chile, I worked with Prof. Monica Rubio characterizing physical properties of molecular clouds in the Magellanic Bridge to ultimately reevaluate the necessary conditions for stellar birth. Using observations from ALMA and APEX, I analyzed sub-millimeter CO emission via CASA Gaussian fit distribution modeling. Our results estimated the size, temperature, luminosity, and mass of clouds covering one-third of the Bridge, thus establishing a foundation to interrogate stellar evolution within low-density environments. From my experience in Chile, I not only learned the technical skills of radio observation and spectral data reduction, but also initiated scientific collaborations with one of the leading countries in observational astronomy.

								<h3>Software Development for the Hubble and James Webb Space Telescopes</h3>
                                                                <img class="center fit"src="images/hubble.jpg" width="1035px" height="260px">
								<p>Immediately after graduation, I was selected as a STScI Space Astronomy Summer Program (SASP) Student, where I developed software for the HST and JWST SPIKE observation scheduling systems. Working with Dr. Mark Giuliano, I created a dynamic visualization tool for the analysis of temporal scheduling constraints, as primarily used by SPIKE Developers and SPIKE Users. The tool is designed to be lightweight (fast, computationally inexpensive), interactive (supporting zooming, scrolling, dynamic time information displays), and independent (producing a stand-alone web page) for optimized functionality and communication among users. Despite being my first experience with both software development and programming in JavaScript and LISP, I quickly acquired skills of product-based problem-solving (communicating with users, adjusting products to user feedback) and programming in multiple new languages simultaneously using wrappers. Over a 10-week program, I completed a powerful tool that will soon be incorporated into both the HST and JWST scheduling systems. <a href="https://webcast.stsci.edu/webcast/detail.xhtml?talkid=5834&parent=1"> Link to SASP Symposium Presentation [55:15 - 1:04:34]</a>.
